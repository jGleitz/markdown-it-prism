# Test

This is a fenced code block with language specification:

```java
public class Foo() {
	public Foo(bar) {
		System.out.println(bar);
	}
}
```

This is one without language specification:

```
public class Foo() {
	public Foo(bar) {
		System.out.println(bar);
	}
}
```

This a indented code block:

    public class Foo() {
    	public Foo(bar) {
    		System.out.println(bar);
    	}
    }
